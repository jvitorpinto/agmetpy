    "# Simulating drainage in soils\n",
    "The movement of water throughout the soil profile is complex due to the great number of physical interactions between the various minerals, particle sizes, pores, water, organic matter and dissolved salts. Various formulations have been proposed to simulate this movement.\n",

    "\n",
    "These calculations are not yet implemented in AgmetPy because it would limit the flexibility to calculate the soil water balance in different timesteps (i.e. other than a day). So we look for a more general approach.\n",

    ">[...] Subsequently the soil water content of the top compartment is updated. The same calculations are repeated for the successive compartments. It is thereby assumed that the cumulative drainage amount $\\sum{D_i} = D_1 + D_2 + \\dots + D_n$ will pass through any compartment as long as its drainage ability is greater than or equal to the drainage ability of the upperlying compartment. By comparing drainage abilities and not soil water contents, the calculation procedure is independent of the soil layer to which succeeding compartments may belong.\n",

    ">If a compartment is reached which drainage ability is smaller than the upperlying compartment, $\\sum{D_i}$ will be stored in that compartment, thereby increasing its soil water content and its drainage ability (Fig 3.7e). If the soil water content of the compartment becomes thereby as high that its drainage ability becomes equal to the drainage ability of the upperlying compartment, the excess of the cumulative drainage amount, increased with the calculated drainage amount $D_i$ of that compartment, will be transferred to the underlying compartment (as is the case in compartment 4 and 5 of Figure 3.7e). If the entire cumulative drainage amount can be stored in a compartment without increasing its soil water content in such a way that its drainage ability becomes equal to that of the upperlying compartment (as is the case in compartment 6), only the calculated drainage amount of that compartment will be transferred to the underlying compartment. If in a compartment the soil water content remains below field capacity, its drainability is zero and no water is transferred to the underlying compartment. At the bottom of the soil profile, the remaining part of $\\sum{D}$ will be lost as deep percolation ($\\sum D =  DP$).\n",
