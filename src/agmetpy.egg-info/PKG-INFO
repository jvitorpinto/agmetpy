# agmetpy

AgmetPy is a Python library aimed at agricultural forecasting, soil water balance, hidrology, and evapotranspiration research. It takes advantages of Numpy's vectorized and fast calculations.

Currently, AgmetPy has a complete set of functions for solar position calculations, atmospheric pressure and radiation balance over agricutural lands. It implements all the necessary functions to estimate reference evapotranspiration following the FAO's guidelines as described in FAO 56 (Allen et al., 1998) as well as classes for most of the soil water balance using the dual Kc approach.

We are working on functions to improve the methodology for soil water balance.
